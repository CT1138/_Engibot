        "_desc": "Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, the Scout is a fast-running scrapper with a baseball bat and snarky in-your-face attitude. He is the fastest and most mobile mercenary on the battlefield unassisted. Scout's Double Jump helps him outmaneuver slower opponents like the Heavy and navigate the terrain while dodging oncoming bullets and projectiles. Carrying a Scattergun, Pistol, and Bat, he is an ideal class for aggressive fighting and flanking. Scout excels at hit-and-run tactics that sap away enemy health as his high mobility allows him to get in, do damage, and escape before being noticed. However, Scout possesses the lowest default health pool (alongside the Engineer, Sniper, and Spy), leaving him vulnerable on the front line. However, this is a fair trade-off given his ability to run in and out of contested hot spots quickly, enabling him to turn the tide of battle before the enemy team can even take notice.",

Capable of dealing large amounts of explosive damage, whether directly or through splash damage. Armed with his Grenade Launcher and Stickybomb Launcher, the Demoman uses his one good eye and knowledge of his surrounding environment for well-timed stickybomb detonations and precise grenade impacts that send enemies skyward, often in many pieces. His weapons' large splash radius can also work against him, if an enemy manages to catch him at close range he will often take damage from his own explosives as he struggles to defend himself.",

The Engineer's various gadgets include the Sentry Gun, an automated turret that fires at any enemy in range, the Dispenser, a device that restores the health and ammunition of nearby teammates, and Teleporters that quickly transport players from point A to point B.",

As the only class with a consistent healing source, he is often found near the front lines bolstering his teammates.

The Sniper's main role on the battlefield is to pick off important enemy targets from afar using his Sniper Rifle and its ability to deal guaranteed Critical hits with a headshot (with some exceptions). He is effective at long range, but weakens with proximity, where he is forced to use his Submachine Gun or his Kukri. As a result, the Sniper tends to perch on higher grounds or in hard-to-see places, where he can easily pin down enemies at chokepoints.",

Using a unique array of cloaking watches, he can render himself invisible or even feign his own death, letting him infiltrate enemy lines with little chance of detection. His Disguise Kit lets him impersonate any class on either team. With enough skill in the art of deception, the Spy can momentarily fool enemies with his disguise, lulling them into a false sense of security. When the time is right, he can emerge from the woodwork to strike a killing blow, stabbing his unsuspecting \"teammate\" in the back. A backstab with any of the Spy's knives will kill most foes in a single hit â€” provided they are not under the effects of any type of invulnerability.",
